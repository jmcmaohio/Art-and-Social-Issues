					<p>Paul Cadmus was born December 17, 1904 in New York City. His father was a commercial lithographer, and his mother illustrated books. At the age of 15, Cadmus left high school and began his art studies at the National Academy of Design (NAD). He studied with Joseph Pennell and William Auerbach-Levy at the NAD. </p>
					<p>In 1926, Cadmus found employment as a layout artist in a New York advertising agency. In 1931, the artist left his employment as a commercial artist to travel to <st2:place>Europe</st2:place> with his friend, <st2:PersonName><st1:GivenName>Jared</st1:GivenName> <st1:Sn>French</st1:Sn></st2:PersonName>. Upon his return the United States in 1933, Cadmus joined the Public Works of Art Program. His 1934 picture <i>The Fleet’s In! </i>generated considerable notoriety in the ranks of the U.S. Navy. The controversial subject matter helped establish Cadmus’s reputation as a social satirist. </p>
					<p>Although he had been commissioned by <i>Life</i> magazine to depict a significant event in American History after 1925, the magazine later refused to publish Cadmus’s painting <i>Herrin Massacre </i>due to its graphic portrayal of murdered strikebreakers. The egg tempera painting was characteristic of Cadmus’s sharply focused, meticulously rendered, realist approach. </p>
					<p>Besides painting, <st1:Sn>Cadmus</st1:Sn> is also well-known as a printmaker and as a superb draftsman. His paintings have been included in many important exhibitions- most notably the American Realists and magic realists exhibition held in 1943 at The Museum of Modern Art. </p>
					<p>Cadmus left Manhattan in 1961, relocating his studio to Weston, Connecticut where he died in 1999. Works by Cadmus can be found in major public collections including those of the Whitney Museum of American Art; National Museum of American Art; Smithsonian Institution; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art<i>.</i></p>

He later taught summer art school in Missouri with James Turnbull and Thomas Hart Benton.  Jones was harshly criticized for his Communist leanings and left for New York City in 1935.  He created five murals for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), won a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, painted Depression-era images, and worked as a war artist for <i>Life</i> magazine during World War II.  After the war, Jones began to experiment with color silkscreen prints with increasingly abstract subjects.  Jones’s works are held in collections at the Smithsonian Institute, the Toledo Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the White House.</p>

					<p>Walter Quirt was born in Iron River, Michigan.  In 1921, he began studying drawing and composition at the Layton School of Art in Milwaukee where he became a drawing teacher in 1924.  After moving to New York City in 1929, Quirt began painting with oils, leading to his first solo show in 1936.  Quirt painted in what he described as a “Social-Surrealist” style, incorporating allusions to contemporary political events into the dreamy abstraction of Surrealism.  A member of the American Communist Party, Quirt was especially interested in art’s power to help the working class.  From 1935 to 1941, Quirt also participated in the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Art Project.  Quirt returned to teaching in 1945 and joined the faculty of the art department of the University of Minneapolis in 1947.  The Minneapolis Institute of Arts mounted a retrospective exhibition of his work in 1959.</p>

					<p>Born in Moscow, Anton Refregier left Russia when he was fifteen to study sculpture in Paris and immigratied to the United States later that year.  The following year, he entered the Rhode Island School of Design, where he trained as an artist until 1925.  In 1934, Refregier began working with the Federal Arts Project (FAP), alternating between teaching and supervising the art and mural projects.  Notably, he was selected in 1941 to design a twenty-seven-panel mural in the Rincon Annex Post Office in <st1:City><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:City> – at $26,000, the mural was the most expensive public commission of the time.  The work became notorious because of Refregier’s inclusion of several controversial scenes from California history.  Before his death, Refregier returned to his native Moscow.</p>
