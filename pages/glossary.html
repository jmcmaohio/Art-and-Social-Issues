															<p>In 1919, architect Walter Gropius (1993–1969) reorganized the German Art School and renamed it the Bauhaus (Building Institute).  Gropius believed architecture was a collective art, and he organized the school’s campus to create an inter-related complex of studios, machine shops, professors’ houses, etc.  Bauhaus artists explored new approaches to printing, painting, metalcraft, and pottery.  Never forgetting the utilitarian purpose, the objects they designed were intended to serve (eg a chair is intended for sitting).  Gropius’ buildings reflected the technological advancements of the twentieth century.  The Bauhaus fostered the International style of architecture noted for “glass curtain walls.” The school was shut down by the Nazi party in 1933, prompting many of its members to move to the US.</p>

															</div>
															<p>The Farm Security Administration was begun by Rexford Tugwell in 1935 and originally headed by Roy Stryker.  It was started as the Historical Section of the Resettlement Administration with a goal of “<i>communicating the plight of the rural poor and the work of government programs to members of Congress and the American middle class in order to alleviate that poverty</i>.”  It was renamed the Farm Security Administration in 1937 and ultimately became part of the Office of War Information (OWI) in 1942. Many of the poor were moved under this program to group farms on land that was better  for farming.  Though a group of 6 photographers took the bulk of the photos from 1937-43 the organization employed eighteen photographers.  The photos depicted both the ‘natural and social landscape’ of the Midwest, focusing on the lives of the rural poor.  Included in the collection is a section on flooding along the Ohio River in 1937.   In addition to the photos in the Columbus Museum of Art’s Photo League collection, the FSA-OWI photographs are available online through the Library of Congress  American Memory website (http:memory.loc.gov/ammem/fsowhome.html).</p>

															</div>
															<p>A secret society whose ultimate goal is to establish white supremacy. Founded in 1866 at Pulaski, Tennessee, the Ku Klux Klan violently attacked and intimidated African Americans and white Republicans (carpetbaggers and Union League members). Ex-Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest (1862-77), who had massacred black and white Union soldiers at Fort Pillow, was elected its first Grand Wizard. The organization's name is thought to have come from the Greek word for circle (kuklos) and the English word for clan, although some historians and folklorists speculate that it might have had its origins in the phantom Indian chieftain named Clocletz. This spiritual figure was believed, in slave times, to have roamed the Alabama woods hunting for escaped slaves. The Clocletz Indians were indeed an historic people used for that purpose--and many blacks identified the word with terror and capture .</p>

																<b>Lithography:</b> </div>
															<p>Invented in 1798 by Senefelder, lithography is the first printmaking technique<b> </b>to use a level printing area.  (Older techniques worked by carving or incising the design into wood, stone, or metal).  Lithography is possible due to the natural repulsion of oil and water: the artist uses a greasy crayon or liquid to draw a design onto a prepared granular surface (once Bavarian limestone, now more commonly a specially grained alloy plate).  The stone or plate is then dampened.  This makes the surface reject ink, except for the greasy image.  An oil-based ink, which sticks only to the artist’s greasy drawing, is rolled over the stone.  Prints are made by firmly pressing a sheet of paper over the inked stone – the ink that stayed on the waxy drawing transfers to the paper.</p>

																Lynching:</div>
															<p>Hanging, execution; Execution of a presumed offender by a mob without trial, under the pretense of administering justice. It sometimes involves torturing the victim and mutilating the body. Lynching has often occurred under unsettled social conditions. The term derives from the name of Charles Lynch, a Virginian who headed an irregular court to persecute loyalists during the American Revolution. In the United States, lynching was widely used in the post-Reconstruction South against blacks, often to intimidate other blacks from exercising their civil rights.</p>

It was a division of the Treasury Department. The head of the organization, said &quot;There are not enough artists on relief to do our job and maintain the quality for which we stand.&quot; The TRAP’s projects included the painting of murals in at least one post office in each state. Once publicized, a thousand artists submitted nearly 1,500 designs. Each mural was to reflect the regional attributes of the site. At first many of the TRAP artists were chosen through competitions with 1371 pieces commissioned.  Later the organization was told to choose artists from relief rolls at which time the employed artists dropped to 289.                                                                                  <br />
